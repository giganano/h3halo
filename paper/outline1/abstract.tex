% We develop a Bayesian method for fitting one-zone models of galactic chemical
% evolution to observed stellar abundances and ages.
% We demonstrate the accuracy of this method by means of mock data samples, for
% which we are able to recover the known values of evolutionary parameters with
% accuracy and precision consistent with random processes.
% Our tests indicate the measrement precision and sample size are of comparable
% importance in establishing the precision of best-fit parameters, while stellar
% age information plays a significantly weaker role.
% We find that known parameters of a mock sample's evolutionary history,
% including the infall timescale and the duration of star formation, are
% accurately recovered even in the absence of age information.
% We apply this method to the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus and the Sagitarrius dwarf
% Spheroidal using data observed with the H3 survey.
% Our characterization of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus achieves
% $\chi^2_\text{dof} = 1.2$, and the duration of star formation that we derive
% from chemistry alone is consistent with directage constraints.
% This method is based on the treatment of stellar abundances in as a one-zone
% model of galactic chemical evolution sampled according to an inhomogeneous
% poisson point process.
% It requires no binning of the data, and should be extensible to other models
% which predict evolutionary tracks in some observed space (e.g. stellar
% isochrones and stellar streams).
We develop a Bayesian method for fitting one-zone models of galactic chemical
evolution (GCE) to observed stellar abundances and ages, where available.
This method is based on the application of an inhomogeneous poisson point
process (IPPP) to an arbitrary evolutionary track in some observed space.
It should therefore be extensible to other astrophysical models which also
predict tracks (e.g. stellar streams and isochrones), and it requires no
binning of the data.
We demonstrate that this resuts in the derivation of a single exact form of
the likelihood function for determining best-fit parameters.
By means of mock data samples, we demonstrate that this likelihood function
yields best-fit parameters where the fit precision scales with sample size
approximately as~$\sigma / \theta \sim N^{-0.5}$ and that it remains accurate
with as few as~$\sim$20 stars in the sample.
