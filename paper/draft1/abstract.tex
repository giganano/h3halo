We model the stellar abundances and ages of two disrupted dwarf galaxies in the
Milky Way stellar halo:~\gaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE) and Wukong (also known as
LMS-1).
Using a statistically robust likelihood function, we fit one-zone models of
galactic chemical evolution with exponential infall histories to both systems,
deriving e-folding timescales of~$\tau_\text{in} = 1.01 \pm 0.13$ Gyr for GSE
and~$\tau_\text{in} = 3.08^{+3.19}_{-1.16}$ Gyr for Wukong.
GSE formed stars for~$\tau_\text{tot} = 5.40^{+0.32}_{-0.31}$ Gyr, sustaining
star formation for~$\sim$$1.5 - 2$ Gyr after its first infall into the Milky
Way~$\sim$10 Gyr ago.
Our fit suggests that star formation lasted for
$\tau_\text{tot} = 3.36^{+0.55}_{-0.47}$ Gyr in Wukong, though our sample does
not contain any age measurements.
The variations in evolutionary parameters between the two are qualitatively
consistent with simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.
Our fitting method is based only on poisson sampling from an evolutionary
track and requires no binning of the data.
We demonstrate its accuracy by means of tests against mock data, showing that
it accurately recovers the input model across a broad range of sample sizes
($20 \leq N \leq 2000$) and measurement uncertainties
($0.01 \leq \sigma_\afe,~\sigma_\feh \leq 0.5$;
$0.02 \leq \sigma_{\log_{10}(\text{age})} \leq 1$).
The fit precision of the inferred parameters generally scales with sample size
as~$\sim$$1/\sqrt{N}$.
Due to its generic nature, our likelihood function is highly generic and should
be applicable to one-zone models of any parametrization as well as other
astrophysical models which predict tracks in some observed space.
